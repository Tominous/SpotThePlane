SpotThePlane
============

SpotThePlane is a user script for [flightradar24](http://flightradar24.com/) which make it easy to spot the actual plane you've selected in the sky. Just enter your coordinates, zoom to where you are and select a plane. On the left overlay containing information about the plane, a row is named *SpotThePlane* and contains the coordinates of the plane relative to *you*:

 1. Enter your coordinates into the inputs at the top-left of the map
 2. Select a plane to see its details in the left panel
 3. The last row indicates the plane's coordinates relative to yours

## Reading the plane coordinates

The plane coordinates are written in the following format: `<azimuth> <elevation>째 <distance>km`

 - `<azimuth>` indicates where the plane is in reference to the cardinal directions. `N` means North, `WNW` means West-North-West and so on.

 - `<elevation>` indicates where the plane is on the vertical axis. The value is the angle in degrees relative to the horizon. The horizon is at 0째 and the zenith is at 90째. A good rule of thumb is that when you hold your fist at arm's length, then your fist spans 10째 on the sky.

 - `<distance>` is the distance between you and the plane, in kilometers. It's useful to know if you need to search for a tiny dot or for a relatively big shape.

Note: if the plane's altitude is too low to allow for condensation trails to form, then the string `No trails` is appended to the coordinates. However, there might be planes leaving no trails even if the string is not present.
